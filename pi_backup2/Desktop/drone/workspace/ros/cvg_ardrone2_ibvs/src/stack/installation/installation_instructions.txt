EXTERNAL LIBRARIES THAT SHOULD BE INSTALLED
#ncurses
sudo apt-get install libncurses5
sudo apt-get install ncurses-bin
sudo apt-get install ncurses-dev



DEINSTALL ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES OF OTHER (OLDER) VERSIONS OF THE STACK
sed -i '/IBVS_WORKSPACE/d' ~/.bashrc
sed -i '/IBVS_STACK/d' ~/.bashrc




NAVIGATE TO WORKSPACE OF ROS (OR CREATE IT)
#example
cd ~/workspace/ros

CREATE A FOLDER FOR THE WHOLE STACK APPLICATION
mkdir cvg_ardrone2_ibvs
cd cvg_ardrone2_ibvs

CREATION OF THE CATKING WORKSPACE and first built
#if you have groovy
source /opt/ros/groovy/setup.bash
#if you have hydro
source /opt/ros/hydro/setup.bash
#if you have indigo
source /opt/ros/indigo/setup.bash
#common
mkdir src
cd src
catkin_init_workspace
cd ..
catkin_make


SOURCERING THE STACK
source devel/setup.bash


DOWNLOAD STACK
git clone -b catkin https://github.com/Vision4UAV/cvg_ardrone2_ibvs.git ./src/stack


DOWNLOAD EXT_STACK -> For ROS INDIGO. If you are not using ROS Indigo, you should download other branches
#ardrone_autonomy
git clone -b indigo-devel https://github.com/AutonomyLab/ardrone_autonomy.git ./src/extStack/ardrone_autonomy
#ros_opentld
git clone https://github.com/Ronan0912/ros_opentld.git ./src/extStack/ros_opentld


INSTALL THE WORKSPACE -> for the setup.sh
./src/stack/installation/installers/installWS.sh



INSTALL THE STACK -> for the launchers and the logs
cd src/stack
./installation/installers/installStack.sh
cd ..
cd ..


#close terminal and reopen it





COMPILE STACK
cd $DRONE_STACK
source setup.sh
cd $DRONE_WORKSPACE
catkin_make
#we have noticed that it sometimes fails when compiling, because an error in the external package ros_opentld. If it fails, run "catkin_make" again. It solved all our problems from the moment!





OPENING STACK with qtcreator
cd $DRONE_WORKSPACE/src
rm CMakeLists.txt
cp /opt/ros/indigo/share/catkin/cmake/toplevel.cmake CMakeLists.txt
cd ..
source devel/setup.bash
qtcreator
#put the build folder in the correct path!
